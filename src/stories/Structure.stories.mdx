Redux store inspired by ducks proposal on [gitHub](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux)

Tools used to for business logic and data flow
- [Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

Structure clarification
- **`store.ts`** - root place of redux store containing `rootReducer`, `middleware`'s, `enhancer`'s and `storeCreator` for Redux Provider
- **`rootSaga.ts`** - entry point for `sagaMiddleware.run()` (like `rootReducer` but for sagas, see [Beginner Tutorial](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/introduction/BeginnerTutorial.html) for additional clarification)
- **`folder`** - there is `2` type of folders, `combiner` and `store` folder
  - **`combiner folder`** - can only contain `reducers.ts`, `sagas.ts` and `store folders` and his primary function is to bundle `"store's"`
    - **`reducers.ts`** - similar as `rootReducer` contains `combineReducers()` for sub `store`'s
    - **`sagas.ts`** - similar as `rootSaga` contains all sagas from sub folders
  - **`store folder`** - can contain `reducers`, `actions`, `sagas` and `selectors` _(in any file you like)_ but cannot contain `folders`
